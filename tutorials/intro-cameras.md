# Intro Cameras in Forge

Intro Cameras are objects used to create cinematic sequences for pre-game and round intermissions.

## Usage

Intro Cameras require two cameras per sequence. Camera one is placed as "Order 1" and serves as the starting point, while camera two is placed as "Order 2" and serves as the ending point. For example, in sequence 1, camera three is placed as "Order 3" and serves as the starting point, while camera four is placed as "Order 4" and serves as the ending point. Similarly, in sequence 2, camera five is placed as "Order 5" and serves as the starting point, while camera six is placed as "Order 6" and serves as the ending point.

To create smooth transition shots, it is important to physically place, orient, and rotate the Intro Cameras in a way that their movement from start to end does not go through objects. The movement between the two cameras is calculated automatically based on how they are placed.
