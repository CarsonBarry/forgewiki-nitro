# Wraith

## Description

Banished heavy tank armed with a large plasma mortar. A passenger can make use of a rapid-fire plasma cannon for close-range defense. The Wraith floats over the ground with a gravity propulsion drive and can move (slowly) in any direction. The drive's boost move is often used to ram targets that get too close.
