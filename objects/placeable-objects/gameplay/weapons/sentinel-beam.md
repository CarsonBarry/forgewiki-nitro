# Sentinel Beam

## Description

The Sentinel Beam is the primary weapon of Forerunner Sentinels, using shaped beams of superheated particles to sterilize organic material from restricted areas. The beam unit can be salvaged from destroyed Sentinels and used as a heavy weapon by Brutes and Spartans, but has a limited charge with its internal battery.
