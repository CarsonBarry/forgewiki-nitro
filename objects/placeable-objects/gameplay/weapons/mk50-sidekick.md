# Mk50 Sidekick

## Description

Though it lacks big-bore stopping power, the Mk50 Sidekick is very responsive and accurate at short range. Spartans are drilled to equip the pistol very quickly, which allow them to finish off a target if their primary weapon runs out of ammo and they can't take the time to reload.
