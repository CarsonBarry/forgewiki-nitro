# Heatwave

## Description

Discovered in the long-sealed armories of Zeta Halo, the Heatwave is a Forerunner suppression device that fires six hard light projectiles in a side-by-side line with each shot. The orientation of the line can be toggled between horizontal and vertical using the zoom button. Hard light projectiles bounces off the environment and cut through most living targets.
