# Ravager

## Description

The Ravager is a Banished weapon that fires three-round bursts of unstable plasma. Unlike many Banished weapons, it has limited collateral damage with its normal firing mode, but direct hits will cause large amounts of damage. Holding down the trigger charges up an unstable projectile that leaves a burning pool of plasma at the impact point.
