# S7 Sniper

## Description

The Series 7 is the latest entry in the Sniper Rifle System 99 (SRS99) family of weapons. It has a limited magazine capacity, but is utterly deadly even against energy shielded heavy infantry if fired accurately. Take careful aim, and don't waste shots on Grunts or other soft targets.
