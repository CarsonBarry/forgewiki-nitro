# Needler

## Description

The Needler is an exotic Covenant weapon that fires shards of resonant crystal that home-in on living targets. If enough shards are embedded over a short time they will detonate in a massive 'supercombine' explosion. The shards move slowly, but at short range even a Spartan will have difficulty dodging the projectiles.
