# Plasma Grenade

## Description

Plasma Grenades are elegant and deadly explosive devices developed by the Covenant, and now used in large numbers by the Banished and other successor powers. The smart-matter casing allows it to stick to infantry and vehicles, making it extraordinarily deadly in the hands of skilled users. Stuck plasma grenades bypass shields.
