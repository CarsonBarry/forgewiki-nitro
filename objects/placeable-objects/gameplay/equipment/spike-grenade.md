# Spike Grenade

## Description

Banished anti-infantry grenade which is crude and deadly in a particularly brutish combination. The blades on the grenade case allow it to embed itself on a target before detonating, blurring the distinction between grenade and limpet mine. Embedded spike grenades bypass shields.
