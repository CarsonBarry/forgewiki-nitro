# Dynamo Grenade

## Description

Banished energy grenade which repeatedly emits with lightning arcs after being thrown. The arcs do shock damage and chain to additional enemies in close proximity. Targets hit by the lightning arcs have reduced movement speed for a short time. Skilled users can utilize the grenade's low bounce friction to create a trajectory that moves the projectile past targets while dealing damage.
