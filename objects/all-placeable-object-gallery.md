# All Placeable Objects Gallery

Note: Current as of Season 2

This canvas, created by an experienced Forger MythicFritz and published in their files as "All Objects," serves as an essential starting point for new projects or as a comprehensive object palette for experienced builders. The canvas can be accessed via the link: https://www.halowaypoint.com/halo-infinite/ugc/maps/6960de10-392d-4c88-a7ad-d6d36b9a290d

The "All Objects Canvas" is meticulously curated to include all forgeable objects in Halo Infinite, making it a one-stop-shop for creators to access a vast array of objects to use in their Forge creations. The objects are carefully selected to exclude effects and gameplay objects that may introduce unnecessary noise or clutter in Forge projects. Instead, only MP (Multiplayer) objects are included, with non-MP versions placed only if the MP version is unavailable.

One notable feature of the "All Objects Canvas" is the thoughtful organization of objects by their menu category. This makes it easy for creators to quickly locate and select objects from various categories, such as scenery, structures, vehicles, weapons, and more.
