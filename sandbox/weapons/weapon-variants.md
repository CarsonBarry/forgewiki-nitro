# Variants[^1]

### MA40 Longshot (Assault Rifle)
    Effective distance: 30.4m(+6m or +25%)
    Mag Size: 25(-11)
    TTK: .87 seconds
    Zoom Level: 1.65x(+.25x)
    Notes: Longer range AR, definitely just a solid upgrade all around from vanilla AR.

### Striker Sidekick
    Effective distance: 34.5m (+10m or +41%)
    Mag Size: 14 (+2)
    TTK: .52 seconds
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Notes: 4 shot kill (-3). Less bloom but more recoil. Very very good variant, even better than halo 5 pistol.

### BR75 Breacher
    Effective distance: 24.2m (-12m or -33% range)
    Mag Size: 30 (-6)
    TTK: 0.91 seconds (-0.39)
    Zoom Level: 1.65x (-.85x)
    Special Nuances: Knowing you lose a third of your range compared to vanilla, you can't really use this gun as you would a traditional BR. But very effective close range and is a 3 burst kill. Vanilla BR is still king during mid to high range combat.

### Impact Commando
    Effective distance: 18.1m (-18m or -50%)
    Mag Size: 40(+20)
    TTK: .75 seconds (-.85 or 46% faster)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x (-.25x)
    Special Nuances: Although this gun looks good on paper with a potential 6 shot kill and a 46% faster ttk, more overall damage and a larger mag; it is actually very unlikely you'll hit those numbers due to its massively cut range, high bloom and slower rof. You can only reliably hit most shots by pacing your shots very slowly. I would not pick this gun up under most circumstances.

### Calcine Disruptor
    Effective distance: 30m
    Mag Size: 7 (-3)
    TTK: 1.16 (-1.2 or 50% faster)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances:Has Area of Effect (AOE) "aftershocks," but there seems to be no Damage Over Time (DOT) effects from the AOE bullets. Very low ammo in reserves, but in general a good upgrade from vanilla.

### Unbound Plasma Pistol
    Effective distance: 60.6m
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: Instant
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Charged shots shoot 5 bullets and can actually one shot kill to the head a-la Halo 4 boltshot. Non charged shots have bigger bullets and track slower.

### Riven Mangler
    Effective distance: 15m
    Mag Size: 8
    TTK: 0.9 seconds (-.36 or %40 faster)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: This mangler shoots 3 bullets simultaneously which allows you to kill in 2, or one shot melee.

### Ravager Rebound
    Effective distance: 15m(-15m or 50% less)
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: Don't kid yourself
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Bounces multiple times before exploding. Pretty useless. Overheat rates are the same as vanilla. Fire AOE effect is largely the same as vanilla. You can't kill a full health spartan with a charged AOE shot. Effectively worse than vanilla at both non-charged and charged shot capabilities.

### Rapidfire Pulse Carbine
    Effective distance: 32.9m (-4)
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: 1.12 Seconds
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: 2 burst kill, 5 shots to overheat. Largely the same as vanilla but slight upgrade due to faster rate of fire.

### Pinpoint Needler
    Effective distance: 37.2m (+7m or +23% more)
    Mag Size: 30 (+4 more)
    TTK: .72 (-.47 or 40% faster)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Can lock on to enemies and shoot around corners. 8 needles required to supercombine which is 4 less than vanilla. The lock on mechanic lasts for about 4 seconds when the enemy is out of line of sight. Solid upgrade from vanilla, you can effectively kill 3 enemies in one mag and shoot around corners after lock on.

### Pursuit Hydra
    Effective distance: 180m (+90m or +100% more range)
    Mag Size: 6
    TTK: 1.4 seconds
    Special Nuances: Faster lock on and almost 2x more lock on distance with increased rocket velocity makes this a gun to be feared for both man and machine. You should be able to cross-map lock on for most situations, and it is a 3 shot kill (-1 compared to vanilla on lock-on mode). Solid upgrade but still has a low amount of total ammo and slow reload speed.

### Arcane Sentinel Beam
    Effective distance: As far as the beam goes, red reticle is irrelevant
    Mag Size: 80 (-170 or 68% less)
    TTK: .42 (-2.92 or (83% faster) (FAST!)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Although this gun has very low total ammo,it boasts one of the fastest ttk's. This gun is a must pick up, just practice ammo management.

### Convergence Bulldog
    Effective distance: 31.5m (+13 or 75% more range)
    Mag Size: 12 (+5)
    TTK: .6 seconds (-.35 or 38% faster)
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Significantly longer range and more damage, more consistent 2 shot and a higher mag. A serious upgrade from vanilla.Here's a clip of how deadly the range is (custom games 1v8 against bots infinite ammo).

### Scatterbound Heatwave
    Mag Size: 8
    TTK: 0.46 seconds
    Special Nuances: Bullets track after each ricochet, allowing you to consistently get 2 shot kills if you shoot horizontally right in front of the enemy.

### Purging Shock Rifle
    Effective distance: 36.2m
    Mag Size: 15 (+3 more than vanilla)
    TTK: Instant
    Special Nuances: Bursts shoot 5 bullets instead of 3. Can body shot in 2 bursts, and can disable vehicles in one burst. Because it shoots 5 bullets, you get 3 bursts per mag instead of the 4 bursts of the vanilla. Solid upgrade.

### S7 Flexfire Sniper
    Effective distance: 27m
    Mag Size: 10 (+6 or %150 more)
    TTK: .25ttk
    Zoom Level: 3x
    Special Nuances: Oddly enough this gun cannot kill in one shot, but comes with a lot of pros. It has increased rate of fire, a large magazine, and a highly accurate no scope. I would treat this as a 2 shot stalker.A serious upgrade if used in low to mid range combat.

### Volatile Skewer
    Mag Size: 1
    TTK: Instant
    Special Nuances: Explodes shortly after impact with environment, and explodes immediately after impact with enemy. Might be able to kill an overshield enemy in one shot.

### Stalker Rifle Ultra
    Effective distance: 28.5m (+7m or %32 more)
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: 1.05 ~same with vanilla
    Zoom Level: 1.65x (-.35x)
    Special Nuances: Increased rate of fire, reduced heat and damage output. Otherwise it is mostly the same as vanilla

### Rushdown Hammer
    Effective distance: 13m (+8m or +160%)
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: Instant
    Special Nuances: A serious upgrade to the vanilla hammer with a higher jump, faster sprint, farther slide, and a significantly increased range to kill. You literally cannot chip damage a spartan, because as soon as you get in range to do damage you straight up kill him.

### Duelist Energy Sword
    Effective distance: 11.7m (+4m or +52%)
    Mag Size: Battery
    TTK: Instant
    Special Nuances: As with the hammer, a great upgrade with all the mobility upgrades.

### Backdraft Cindershot
    Effective distance: 24.4m
    Mag Size: 6
    TTK: instant
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Shoots 3 bullets instead of 1which allows you to kill in one burst. But oddly compared to vanilla this gun has no black hole effect.

### M41 Tracker
    Effective distance: 68.4m (+45.5m or +198% more range)
    Mag Size: 2
    TTK: Instant
    Zoom Level: 1.4x
    Special Nuances: Locks on to target just like the pinpoint needler, a very solid upgrade.
