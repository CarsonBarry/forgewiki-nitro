# Weapon Combinations

Via scripting in Forge, users can generate hybridized weapons by combining the model, ammo/magazine/battery capacity, projectile spawning patterns, and fire rate of a base weapon with the projectiles and projectile behavior of a second weapon. 

This is a nod to, and legitmization of, a bug in Halo 5 that allowed for similar combinations to be done using stock and "requisition" weapons via Weapon Pads. Unfortunately, this was only doable using Weapon Pads. When this was found, 343 announced intentions to leave it in rather than removing the bug.

Now, not only can any weapon placed on a level be set up as a hybrid weapon, weapons *in players inventories* can be detected, checked against variables, and directly modified. Ammo/battery capacity, magazine size, and even the current ammo/charge count can be modified via scripts both while a weapon is on the rack/ground, or when it is in a player's inventory. This, combined with being able to detect things like the player's zoom, crouch, and airborne states, creates a wide range of possibilities for weapons that are even more dynamic.
