# Cancelling Custom Equipment Animation

The Lower Player Weapon node can be used to cancel equipment animations.

This can also be achieved by modifying the equipment in a player's inventory using scripts, specifically by taking the equipment away from the player, or by replacing it with other equipment. However, this method is not recommended because it is often unreliable and can result in a jarring experience for the player. When the server and the client are not in sync, there is also usually a severe animation stutter, which is not desirable. You can experience both of these things when playing Escalation Slayer, for instance. 

Moreover, cancelling the animation of custom equipment also stops the effect of the equipment if it wasn't instantaneous. For example, if the cancellation happens before Thruster distance is completed, it will be cut off, and the grappleshot will disconnect from surfaces.

In conclusion, while cancelling custom equipment animation is possible, it is important to use reliable methods to ensure a seamless and uninterrupted gaming experience for the player.
