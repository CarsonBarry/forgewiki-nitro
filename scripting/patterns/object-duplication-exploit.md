# Halo Infinite Object Duplication Exploit

This wiki entry demonstrates how to exploit a duplication method in Halo Infinite by taking advantage of the game's object respawning system.

## Example/Proof of Concept

1. Make any object dynamic, with normal physics, respawn on disturbed, and timer = 1.
2. Place the object in the map and raise it into the air by 25 units.
3. In PLAY mode, observe the object falling and respawning.

## Normal Set Up (Prequisite to Script)

1. Make an object dynamic, with any physics setting
2. Change the respawn properties to the following: respawn = ON, condition = disturbed, and timer = 1
3. Place the object in an unseen aea of your map where players cannot interact with it.

## Duplication Script

### Simple Duplication

This script duplicates all objects within the area monitor and places them at the marked player location while maintaining their orientation.

1. Place a script brain above the object(s) you want to duplicate.
   a. Turn on the area monitor and adjust the size to surround ONLY the object(s).
2. Place a pointer a little bit to the side of the script brain.
   a. Turn on the area monitor and adjust the size to be a bit larger than the script brain's.
3. The script brain's area monitor contains the parent object which is what is duplicated. Those duplicates are placed in the pointer area monitor.
4. The pointer's area monitor is where the duplicates or child objects are pulled from.
5. Select the script brain and open the node graph menu to add the script brain as an object reference.

### Advanced Duplication

This method duplicates many objects quickly, creating multiple duplicates in sets of 5, 10, or powers of 2.

1. Place a script brain above the object(s) you want to duplicate.
   a. Turn on the area monitor and adjust the size to surround ONLY the object(s).
2. Place a pointer a little bit to the side of the script brain.
   a. Set the distance along 1 axis and remember the figure.
   b. Turn on the area monitor and adjust the size to be a bit larger than the script brain's.
   c. Do NOT overlap the area monitors.
3. The script brain's area monitor contains the parent object which is what is duplicated. Those duplicates are placed in the pointer area monitor.
4. The pointer's area monitor is where the duplicates or child objects are pulled from.
5. Select both the pointer and script brain and open the node graph menu to add both as object references.

This method requires a more advanced script, with five main components:

1. Variable declaration
2. Initial setup
3. Automatic duplication
4. On Player Mark event to begin duplication
5. Main script that places duplicated objects

The script runs recursively, continuing to duplicate objects until the programmed amount of duplicates is placed.
